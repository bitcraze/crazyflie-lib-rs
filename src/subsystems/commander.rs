//! # Low level setpoint subsystem
//!
//! This subsystem allows to send low-level setpoint. The setpoints are described as low-level in the sense that they
//! are setting the instant target state. As such they likely need to be send very often to have the crazyflie
//! follow the wanted flight profile.
//!
//! The Crazyflie has a couple of safety mechanisms that one needs to be aware of in order to send setpoints:
//!  - When using the [Commander::setpoint_rpyt()] function, a setpoint with thrust=0 must be sent once to unlock the thrust
//!  - There is a priority for setpoints in the Crazyflie, this allows app and other internal subsystem like the high-level
//!    commander to set setpoints in parallel, only the higher priority setpoint is taken into account.
//!  - In no setpoint are received for 1 seconds, the Crazyflie will reset roll/pitch/yawrate to 0/0/0 and after 2 seconds
//!    will fallback fallback to a lower-priority setpoint which in most case will cut the motors.
//!
//! The following example code would drive the motors in a ramp and then stop:
//! ``` no_run
//! # use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};
//! # async fn ramp(crazyflie: crazyflie_lib::Crazyflie) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Unlock the commander
//! crazyflie.commander.setpoint_rpyt(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0).await?;
//!
//! // Ramp!
//! for thrust in (0..20_000).step_by(1_000) {
//!     crazyflie.commander.setpoint_rpyt(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, thrust).await?;
//!     sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
//! }
//!
//! // Stop the motors
//! crazyflie.commander.setpoint_rpyt(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
